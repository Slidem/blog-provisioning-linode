# Blog Provisioning on Linode

After one year on AWS, the free tier is over, so it makes no sense to keep
a blog on AWS, paying ~ 40$/month.

I've moved my blog to Linode. The only thing I still have, is the dns name, and hosted zone in route53.
I've created an A record that points to Linode public ip.

That's it, enjoy !
